## Responsive Landing Page 

Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. Use HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.

## Task: Stopwatch web Application


To build a stopwatch web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, you can create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.
This web app is a user-friendly stopwatch application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, along with the ability to record lap times. The intuitive interface makes it simple for users to track time efficiently. To get started, follow the installation instructions to run the app locally. You can also check out a live demo [link to your demo if available]. We welcome contributions and bug reports, so feel free to get in touch or submit issues on GitHub. Please refer to the license for terms of use. Thank you for using our stopwatch web app, and we hope it serves you well.
